# Summary of What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Git, especially in the context of collaboration. I learned how to:

- 🔀 Resolve merge conflicts.
- 💻Successfully merge different branches.
- 🤝 Work with multiple branches in a collaborative environment.

Previously, my experience with Git was limited to pushing and pulling changes in individual tasks. This project allowed me to expand my skills in version control and collaboration.

# Collaboration Experience

Collaboration with **Yulisa** was a key part of this learning process. She helped me identify and resolve a branching issue when I attempted to merge branches without publishing the feature branch first. This caused confusion as the changes weren't visible in the remote repository, but with her help, the issue was quickly addressed.

Additionally, Yulisa and I demonstrated a solid collaborative workflow by:

- 🍴 **Forking the repository**: She forked the project and made her changes independently.
- ✍️ **Adding a `feedback.md` file**: She contributed a valuable feedback file to the project.
- 🔄 **Successfully merging**: After Yulisa made her changes, I successfully merged them back into the main branch without conflicts.
