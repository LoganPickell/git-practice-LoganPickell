## Line Profiling
 
Bottleneck found in:
- `expensive_op`: Took ~3s for 1000 calls
 
### Fix:
- Replaced loop with arithmetic formula
- Also tested with `lru_cache` â€” No improvement. 
 
## Code Coverage
 
- Coverage before: ~76%
- Coverage after: 100%
- `unused_function()` was not covered, removed
 
## Fix Summary
 
- Removed dead code and unused imports
- Rewrote `expensive_op` using a math formula
- Simplified loop using list comprehension
- Confirmed coverage and performance improvements
